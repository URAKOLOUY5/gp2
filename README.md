Addon that adds support for Portal 2 maps for Garry's Mod. 

Due to the scope of Garry's Mod it is not possible to add support for Vscripts and so on, so support for maps on the engine level is not possible.

## The main purpose of the addon
That minimum to make Portal 2 maps and mods work in GMod.

## Features

* Implemented Vscript be-like system (isolated Lua environments per entity)
* **`WIP`** Rewritten Squirrel scripts on Lua
* **`WIP`** Recreated/ported entities (buttons, doors, NPCs and more)
* No edited maps, just mount Portal 2, install addon and play
* Recompiled models to fix compatibility with Garry's Mod

# Code guideline
At this point, there is no clear codestyle or rules. Feel free to **make changes**, as this is what is needed at the moment. 

Actually, you can consider codebase as trash, but clean code isn't a priority at the moment.

# Credits
Most features are using inspiration and implementation ideas from  **[EpicSentry/P2ASW](https://github.com/EpicSentry/P2ASW)**.
